# FAIL-CLOSED publish guard. Runs immediately before EVERY npm publish and refuses (exit 1)
# unless the channel's invariants all hold. The cardinal rule it enforces: a nightly build can
# only ever reach the `nightly` tag, and a stable build can only ever reach @latest from main —
# the two paths are mutually unreachable, so nothing on the prerelease branch can move @latest.
#
# Usage: publish-guard.sh <channel> <package.json> <intended-npm-tag>
#   channel  = nightly | stable
#   package.json = path to the package about to be published
#   intended-npm-tag = the exact --tag value the caller will pass to `npm publish`
#
# nightly channel asserts:
#   - version matches *-nightly.*      (a semver pre-release; sorts below the clean X.Y.Z)
#   - intended tag == "nightly"        (never the default `latest` tag)
# stable channel asserts:
#   - GITHUB_REF == refs/heads/main    (stable publishes ONLY from main)
#   - version has NO prerelease suffix (a clean X.Y.Z)
#   - intended tag is "latest" or empty (the npm default)

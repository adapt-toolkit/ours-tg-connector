// ours messenger packet.
//
// One ADAPT node == one of these packets. Two nodes talk directly, peer to
// peer, through a relay broker (no central server). Messages are end-to-end
// encrypted; the key exchange is handled for us by the stdlib `encrypted_channel`
// library — we only ever address peers by their container id.
//
// The shared transaction logic lives in the ours-mufl-core repo (checked
// out as the core/ subfolder of this directory): `a2a_protocol` (wire shapes +
// verification), `a2a_messaging` (contact + message wire path, addressed
// ::a2a_messaging::<name> by the host), and `version`. They are shared with
// the web messenger — change them there, bump core_version, and recompile
// every consumer.
//
// This packet keeps only what is agent-specific:
//   - the inbox message store with its lifecycle (unread -> processed ->
//     ready_to_delete -> deleted; see get_messages / gc / defer_messages)
//   - the local contact book + identity hierarchy transactions (host-fired)
//   - export_state / import_state wrappers composing the core helpers with
//     the app-side fields (including the legacy-blob migrations)
//   - ::actor:: compat shims for the network-visible inbound transactions
//     (accept_contact, receive_message) — pre-migration peers send to these
//     names, and the core keeps SENDING to them too (Option A: zero network
//     break; drop both only when no old clients remain)
//
// Storage is wired into the core via a2a_messaging::init hooks (see the
// hidden block): on_message_received deposits into the inbox (or the
// pending-introduction queue for unknown senders); send/remove hooks are
// agent no-ops.
//
// User transactions (each backs one MCP tool, except gc which the host fires):
//   ::a2a_messaging::set_my_name        — set the display name peers see for me
//   ::a2a_messaging::set_my_bio         — set my profile bio (free-text, self-asserted)
//   ::a2a_messaging::generate_invite    — make an invite blob for a named peer
//   ::a2a_messaging::add_contact        — join via an invite blob, reply to the inviter
//   ::a2a_messaging::send_message       — send an e2e-encrypted message to a contact
//   ::a2a_messaging::remove_contact     — forget a contact
//   ::a2a_messaging::list_contacts      — (readonly) my contacts
//   ::a2a_messaging::list_contact_roots — (readonly) verified root linkage per contact
//   ::a2a_messaging::get_version        — (readonly) shared-core version
//   list_incoming_messages  — (readonly) my inbox, with per-message id + status
//   get_messages            — return unread messages + mark them processed (sole body egress)
//   defer_messages          — flip processed/ready_to_delete messages back to unread
//   gc                      — two-generation GC of handled messages (host-fired, not a tool)
//
// Identity hierarchy (host-fired transactions; see IDENTITY-HIERARCHY-DESIGN.md):
//   sign_delegation         — root-only in practice: sign a delegation cert for a role
//   export_root_profile     — root-only in practice: my self-signed root profile blob
//   set_delegation          — role: store my verified delegation cert + root material
//   describe_identity       — (readonly) name/bio/hierarchy position
//   connect_sibling         — register an intra-root peer + send sibling_introduce
//
// Local contact book (host-fired transactions; see the design notes above
// local_introduce below):
//   export_address_document — (readonly) my signed address document as a blob
//   pin_registrar           — pin the host registrar's signing keys (pin-once)
//   set_local_policy        — toggle auto-accept of local introductions
//   mint_introduction       — registrar-only in practice: sign an introduction credential
//   sign_book_entry         — registrar-only in practice: sign a contact-book entry
//   connect_local           — register a book contact + send local_introduce (+ first message)
//   approve_introduction    — accept a pending local introduction (flushes its queue)
//   reject_introduction     — drop a pending local introduction
//   list_pending_introductions — (readonly) pending introductions (names + queue sizes)
//
// Monitoring + control plane (host-fired unless noted; see
// MONITORING-AND-SHARED-LIBRARY-DESIGN.md):
//   get_monitoring_status   — (readonly) enabled flag / proxy binding / queue sizes
//   sign_monitoring_auth    — root-only: sign an enable/disable auth for a role
//   set_monitoring          — role: verify the root-signed auth, set the flag
//   get_monitoring_copies   — root: drain queued copies for proxy forwarding
//   get_control_requests    — root: drain queued proxy control requests
//   set_proxy_pending       — root: store the host-generated 6-digit code
//   verify_proxy_code       — root: check a bind attempt (atomic attempts/expiry)
//   clear_monitoring_proxy  — root: drop the proxy binding
//   ::a2a_control::send_control — send an opaque control payload to a contact
//
// External transactions (inbound, not exposed as tools):
//   accept_contact          — inviter learns the joiner's identity + name (core shim)
//   receive_message         — store a decrypted inbound message (core shim)
//   receive_monitoring_copy — a monitored role of mine reports a message copy
//   ::a2a_control::control_message — control payload from a contact (queued for the daemon)
//   local_introduce         — same-host peer connects via the local contact book
//   sibling_introduce       — intra-root peer connects, authorized by its delegation cert
